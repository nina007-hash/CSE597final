# CSE597finalproject - Reproducing MeaCap_ToT for zero-shot image captioning tasks

## Test and Evaluate
We mainly evaluated the accuracy of the generated captions on MSCOCO Karpathy-test split and NoCaps validations set using CIDEr score, and the specific code and files are in evaluation branch, which includes a README to explain the evaluation process.

## Fine-tune CBART on Flickr30K
We fine-tuned the CBART model on Flickr30k to further evaluate and validate the performance of MeaCap_ToT. The code and files are in master branch, including a README for the detailed steps.
